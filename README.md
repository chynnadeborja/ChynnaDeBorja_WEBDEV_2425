# ChynnaDeBorja_WEBDEV_2425
This portfolio shows my skills, projects, and background in programming. I included sections where you can learn more about me, explore the projects I did, see the programming languages and tools that I'm good at. There's also a contact form that makes it easy for you to reach out to me for collaborations or inquiries. I hope through this portfolio, you'll be able to get a glimpse into my growth as a developer.

**Instruction on how to clone the repository:**
First of all, make sure you have a GitHub account and access to the repository you want to clone. Download and install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and install Live Server extension.
Second, open VSCode. Go to the Terminal tab (View --> Terminal). Use the git clone command to clone the repository, replacing https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git with the actual URL of the repository. This will create a local copy of the repository in your chosen library.

Ex:
git clone https://github.com/chynnadeborja/ChynnaDeBorja_WEBDEV_2425.git

Third, navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository using the File Explorer in VSCode.Then, open the folder by clicking on it. The repository's files should appear in the VSCode workspace.
Lastly, ensure that the file you want to serve as the main HTML file is open in VSCode (e.g., index.html). Right-click on the file and select "Open with Live Server". A web browser will open and display the website. Any changes you make to the files will be automatically reflected in the browser.
